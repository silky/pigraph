# PiGraph

Problems:

* Problem: Cross-language microservices are hard to integration-test
* Problem: Agreement on service boundary protocols is ad-hoc
* Problem: It is hard to visualise your program.
* Problem: It is hard to ensure that you don't have cyclic deps in your programs.
* Problem: It is hard to quantify the effect boundaries of your programs.

With PiGraph:

* Draw graphs.
* Run programs.
* Compile for distributed computation.
* Experience correct-by-construction UI.
* Type-check your graphs before run-time.
* Specify the boudaries of your systems before distribution.
* Allow overloadable interface defaults.
* Enabling testing of custom implementations.
* Decorate sub-graphs for run-time behaviour.
* Write in FRP style for big-data.

Using:

* Typechecker from [Pikelet](https://github.com/pikelet-lang/pikelet#pikelet)
* Rust WASM example from [medium.com/@atulanand94](https://medium.com/@atulanand94/using-rust-modules-for-javascript-web-development-part-i-e6dec27df7b2)
